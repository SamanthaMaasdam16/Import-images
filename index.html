            <p>
                I enjoy Jeremiah 29:13 because it reminds me of the importance of seeking God with my whole heart. The verse says, “You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart,” and that promise gives me comfort and encouragement. 
                It reminds me that God is not distant or hard to reach, but rather He is ready to be found by those who earnestly look for Him. 
                This verse inspires me to be intentional in my faith, to pray sincerely, and to trust that God will meet me where I am. 
                It gives me hope that no matter what I’m going through, if I truly seek Him, I will find peace, guidance, and strength.
